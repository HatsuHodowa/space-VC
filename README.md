### Project Description
AstroFinance is a financial literacy game meant to educate young adults in the community on how to navigate their financial futures through an in-game persona. This project was created using Tkinter for the view and controller. The entire logic for the game was developed in Python and modeled on real-life financial outcomes. We used normal distribution models to calculate the financial risk aversion. The business and personal income tax mechanisms are meant to simulate real world financial situations when taxes are due in April. The player will also have to pay down the loans that they take out towards the assets that they choose. To speed things up as the player moves through the game, we accelerated the appreciation time as the player moves through one month at a time. This game is meant to be a simulation of taking on real-world risk to educate young children on financial literacy in a fun and interactive manner. 

Please ensure that you install all dependencies to run the project using "pip3 install -r requirements.txt."

### Lore
Saddle your rockets and get ready for the greatest space adventure of your life. You start out as a fresh computer science college graduate student that can't get a software engineering job post-graduation. Rather than dwelling over this, you decide to begin paving your own financial freedom journey so you open up a new bank account and get to working on your long and exciting financial journey. You find a job at Unicorn Space, an international space company as a janitor until an engineering manager notices your computer science skills and offers to teach you about aerospace engineering. Being in the position of not having a professional career, you decide to take up the offer to join the company as a new Aerospace Engineer. This is when you make the decision to go explore the outward frontier and progress through your financial journey, meeting aliens, investing in the space real estate and stock markets, and lastly, interplanetary business.

### Features

#### Assets
You may buy and sell assets with liabilities. A player has the option to pay off their liabilities and their goal is to make sure that they do not go bankrupt with the level of risk that they decide to take on.

#### Appreciation
Appreciation is calculated on your portfolio every month to simulate how making investments can generate an increase in profit. 

#### Loans
Some higher priced assets can be purchased with a loan by making a down payment and paying the loan off as time progresses. Each loan's interest rate is calculated based on the player's credit score. If the player pays back their loans, then they will be rewarded with a higher credit score calculated by the amount they pay off. If the user doesn't have enough money to pay for their assets, then they will need to sell their assets as the collection agency will demand their payments immediately. If the user doesn't have any assets by this time then they will need to restart the game. 

#### Taxes
Taxes are calculated based on the various investment choices you can make. You can choose to get a job where you will be taxed on personal income. If you choose to buy stocks and bonds while receiving passive income from them, then they too will count towards your personal income taxes. If you sell any of your assets, you will be charged a capital gains tax. If you purchase real estate, you may make money off of the income that the property generates but you will also have to pay property taxes yearly, capital gains when sold, and interest on the loan. If the player buys a business, then they will have to pay for business income taxes. If the player defaults on taxes, then the space IRS will demand that you repay the money that you owe. Failure to do so will result in the space IRS confiscating your asset with the closest value to your total tax amount owed.

#### Leveling
The player will be able to go through 9 total levels with Earth as the tutorial. Here they will start out from the perspective of having just earned their first job at Space Unicorn, the space exploration giant on earth. 

#### Catastrophies
Naturally as you go through a real world financial journey, you will face several setbacks at times inhibiting your ability to grow. To simulate this in AstroFinance, we decided to add catastrophies, at random points in the game, a player will face challenges that might set them back financially. This adds a twist to the game, ensuring that the user calculates the decisions they make to reach their end destination. Making it fun while also providing key focus on the journey as opposed to the end result, just like in the real world!
