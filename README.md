# SPACE-VC

### Project Description

### Backstory
Saddle your rockets and get ready for the greatest space adventure of your life. You start out as a fresh computer science college graduate student that can't get a software engineering job post-graduation. Rather than dwelling over this, you decide to begin paving your own financial freedom journey so you open up a new bank account and get to working on your long and exciting financial journey. You find a job at Unicorn Space, an international space company as a janitor until an engineering manager notices your computer science skills and offers to teach you about aerospace engineering. Being in the position of not having a professional career, you decide to take up the offer to join the company as a new Aerospace Engineer.
